## üîß Installation


```bash
pip install chunkator
```

---

## üåü Features

- **High Accuracy**: Handles abbreviations (e.g., "Ph.D."), acronyms, and URLs without breaking sentences incorrectly.
- **Regex-Driven**: Utilizes precompiled regex patterns for lightning-fast processing.
- **Edge-Case Resilience**: Processes text with complex punctuation, initials, or special formatting reliably.
- **Lightweight**: Free of unnecessary dependencies, making it simple to integrate into any Python project.

## üöÄ Why Chunkator??

While tools like NLTK, LangChain, and LlamaIndex provide sentence-splitting functionality, they often fail to handle edge cases effectively. Chunkator excels in:

### 1Ô∏è **Abbreviation Handling**

Chunkator correctly processes abbreviations like "Dr.", "Ph.D.", and "U.S.A.", avoiding improper splits.

**Example Input**:
```text
Dr. Smith is a leading scientist. He earned his Ph.D. in Physics.
```

- **NLTK Output**:
  ```
  ['Dr.', 'Smith is a leading scientist.', 'He earned his Ph.D.', 'in Physics.']
  ```
- **Chunkator Output**:
  ```
  ['Dr. Smith is a leading scientist.', 'He earned his Ph.D. in Physics.']
  ```

---

### 2Ô∏è **Website and Email Parsing**

Chunkator keeps URLs and email addresses intact, unlike other libraries that often split them erroneously.

**Example Input**:
```text
Visit our website at www.example.com. Contact us at support@example.com.
```

- **LangChain Output**:
  ```
  ['Visit our website at www.example.', 'com.', 'Contact us at support@example.', 'com.']
  ```
- **Chunkator Output**:
  ```
  ['Visit our website at www.example.com.', 'Contact us at support@example.com.']
  ```

---

### 3Ô∏è **Ellipses and Multi-Dot Patterns**

Chunkator handles ellipses (...) and similar patterns with precision.

**Example Input**:
```text
She hesitated... but eventually agreed. It was unexpected...
```

- **LlamaIndex Output**:
  ```
  ['She hesitated.', '.', '.', 'but eventually agreed.', 'It was unexpected.', '.', '.', '.']
  ```
- **Chunkator Output**:
  ```
  ['She hesitated... but eventually agreed.', 'It was unexpected...']
  ```

### 4Ô∏è **Efficiency**

Optimized for performance, Chunkator processes large documents faster than traditional libraries, thanks to precompiled regex patterns.

---

## üìñ Usage

Using Chunkator is simple. Here is an example:

```python
from chunkator import sentence_split

# Input text
text = "Dr. Smith is a leading scientist. He earned his Ph.D. in Physics. Visit www.example.com for more info."

# Split into sentences
sentences = sentence_split(text)

# Output
print(sentences)
# Output: ['Dr. Smith is a leading scientist.', 'He earned his Ph.D. in Physics.', 'Visit www.example.com for more info.']
```

## üîç Advanced Use Cases

### Custom Pattern Handling

Chunkator can be customized to handle domain-specific text structures. Modify the library's regex patterns to create tailored solutions for your projects.
