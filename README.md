# sentence-split

Welcome to `sentence-split`, a Python library designed for efficient and precise sentence segmentation. This library provides a robust alternative to existing tools like NLTK, LangChain, and LlamaIndex sentence splitters. With customizable handling of complex text structures, `sentence-split` excels in cases where traditional libraries might fail.

## Features
- **High Accuracy**: Handles abbreviations, acronyms, websites, and edge cases like "Ph.D." without breaking sentences incorrectly.
- **Regex-Driven**: Precompiled regex patterns for faster processing.
- **Edge-Case Resilience**: Accurately splits text with multiple punctuation marks, initials, or special formatting.
- **Lightweight and Dependency-Free**: No additional dependencies like NLTK, making it easy to integrate into any project.

## Why `sentence-split`?
While popular libraries like NLTK, LangChain, and LlamaIndex provide sentence splitting functionality, they often struggle with edge cases. Here's why `sentence-split` stands out:

### **1. Handling Abbreviations**
`sentence-split` processes abbreviations like "Dr.", "Mr.", and "Ph.D." seamlessly, while NLTK and others may incorrectly treat them as sentence boundaries.

#### Example:
Input:
```
Dr. Smith is a leading scientist. He earned his Ph.D. in Physics.
```

- **NLTK Output**:
  - `['Dr.', 'Smith is a leading scientist.', 'He earned his Ph.D.', 'in Physics.']`
- **sentence-split Output**:
  - `['Dr. Smith is a leading scientist.', 'He earned his Ph.D. in Physics.']`

---

### **2. Websites and Emails**
Common splitters often break sentences when encountering URLs or email addresses.

#### Example:
Input:
```
Visit our website at www.example.com. Contact us at support@example.com.
```

- **LangChain Output**:
  - `['Visit our website at www.example.', 'com.', 'Contact us at support@example.', 'com.']`
- **sentence-split Output**:
  - `['Visit our website at www.example.com.', 'Contact us at support@example.com.']`

---

### **3. Multi-Dot Handling**
`sentence-split` correctly handles ellipses and other multi-dot patterns.

#### Example:
Input:
```
She hesitated... but eventually agreed. It was unexpected...
```

- **LlamaIndex Output**:
  - `['She hesitated.', '.', '.', 'but eventually agreed.', 'It was unexpected.', '.', '.', '.']`
- **sentence-split Output**:
  - `['She hesitated... but eventually agreed.', 'It was unexpected...']`

---

### **4. Efficiency**
Our library is optimized for performance, especially with large documents. Precompiled regex patterns make `sentence-split` faster compared to NLTK, which relies on tokenizers that can be slower for massive inputs.

## Installation
Install `sentence-split` via pip:

```bash
pip install sentence-split
```

---

## Usage
Here's how to use the `sentence-split` library in your projects:

```python
from sentence_split import sentence_split

# Input text
text = "Dr. Smith is a leading scientist. He earned his Ph.D. in Physics. Visit www.example.com for more info."

# Split into sentences
sentences = sentence_split(text)

# Output
print(sentences)
# Output: ['Dr. Smith is a leading scientist.', 'He earned his Ph.D. in Physics.', 'Visit www.example.com for more info.']
```

## Advanced Use Cases

### Custom Text Processing
`sentence-split` can be extended to handle custom patterns or rules. Modify the regex patterns in the library to suit your specific needs.
