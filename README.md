# Chunkator - Chunk It Right!

Welcome to **Chunkator**, your go-to open-source Python library for accurate and efficient sentence chunking. Built to outperform traditional chunking tools like NLTK, LangChain, and LlamaIndex, Chunkator handles complex text structures with ease, making it a reliable choice for all your text processing needs.

---

## 🔧 Installation


```bash
pip install chunkator
```

---

## 🌟 Features

- **High Accuracy**: Handles abbreviations (e.g., "Ph.D."), acronyms, and URLs without breaking sentences incorrectly.
- **Regex-Driven**: Utilises precompiled regex patterns for lightning-fast processing.
- **Edge-Case Resilience**: Processes text with complex punctuation, initials, or special formatting reliably.
- **Page-Aware Chunking**: Automatically merges sentences broken across pages and removes pagination artefacts like "Page 2 of 5".
- **Hyphenation Handling**: Rejoins words split with hyphens at line breaks (e.g., "recom-\nmendation" → "recommendation").
- **Lightweight**: Free of unnecessary dependencies, making it simple to integrate into any Python project.

## 🚀 Why Chunkator?

While tools like NLTK, LangChain, and LlamaIndex provide sentence-splitting functionality, they often fail to handle edge cases effectively. Chunkator excels in:

### 1️ **Abbreviation Handling**

Chunkator correctly processes abbreviations like "Dr.", "Ph.D.", and "U.S.A.", avoiding improper splits.

**Example Input**:
```text
Dr. Smith is a leading scientist. He earned his Ph.D. in Physics.
```

- **NLTK Output**:
  ```
  ['Dr.', 'Smith is a leading scientist.', 'He earned his Ph.D.', 'in Physics.']
  ```
- **Chunkator Output**:
  ```
  ['Dr. Smith is a leading scientist.', 'He earned his Ph.D. in Physics.']
  ```

---

### 2️ **Website and Email Parsing**

Chunkator keeps URLs and email addresses intact, unlike other libraries that often split them erroneously.

**Example Input**:
```text
Visit our website at www.example.com. Contact us at support@example.com.
```

- **LangChain Output**:
  ```
  ['Visit our website at www.example.', 'com.', 'Contact us at support@example.', 'com.']
  ```
- **Chunkator Output**:
  ```
  ['Visit our website at www.example.com.', 'Contact us at support@example.com.']
  ```

---

### 3️ **Ellipses and Multi-Dot Patterns**

Chunkator handles ellipses (...) and similar patterns with precision.

**Example Input**:
```text
She hesitated... but eventually agreed. It was unexpected...
```

- **LlamaIndex Output**:
  ```
  ['She hesitated.', '.', '.', 'but eventually agreed.', 'It was unexpected.', '.', '.', '.']
  ```
- **Chunkator Output**:
  ```
  ['She hesitated... but eventually agreed.', 'It was unexpected...']
  ```

---

### 5️ **Efficiency**

Optimized for performance, Chunkator processes large documents faster than traditional libraries, thanks to precompiled regex patterns.


### 5 **Page-Spanning Sentences**

Chunkator intelligently reconstructs sentences broken across page boundaries and removes noisy page markers.

Example Input:

```
This is a sentence that starts on one page
and continues on the next. Page 2 of 5
But this is a new sentence.
```
Chunkator Output:

``` ['This is a sentence that starts on one page and continues on the next.', 'But this is a new sentence.'] ```

### 6️ **Hyphenated Word Merging**

Chunkator rejoins words split by hyphenation at line breaks.

Example Input:

```
The recom-
mendation was accepted.
```
Chunkator Output:

``` ['The recommendation was accepted.'] ```
---

## 📖 Usage

Using Chunkator is simple. Here is an example:

```python
from chunkator import sentence_split

# Input text
text = "Dr. Smith is a leading scientist. He earned his Ph.D. in Physics. Visit www.example.com for more info."

# Split into sentences
sentences = sentence_split(text)

# Output
print(sentences)
# Output: ['Dr. Smith is a leading scientist.', 'He earned his Ph.D. in Physics.', 'Visit www.example.com for more info.']
```
